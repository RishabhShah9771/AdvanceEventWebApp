# AdvanceEventWebApp
  
## Project Overview

AdvanceEventWebApp is a full-featured event management platform built with React. It allows users to register, log in, and manage events securely. The app demonstrates modern authentication techniques and best practices for protecting user data.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Secure authentication using JWT tokens
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Event creation, editing, and deletion
- Responsive UI

## Authentication Flow Example

1. **User Registration:**  
   A new user signs up by providing their email and password. The backend hashes the password and stores user data securely.

2. **Login:**  
   The user logs in with their credentials. If valid, the server returns a JWT token.

3. **Accessing Protected Routes:**  
   The JWT token is stored (usually in localStorage or cookies). When accessing protected pages (like `/dashboard`), the app checks for a valid token before granting access.

4. **Logout:**  
   The user can log out, which removes the token and restricts access to protected routes.

## Example Code Snippet

```js
// Example: Protecting a route in React
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function PrivateRoute({ children }) {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  return token ? children : <Navigate to="/login" />;
}
```

## Important Authentication Topics

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for stateless authentication.
- **Password Hashing:** Ensures passwords are stored securely.
- **Protected Routes:** Only authenticated users can access certain pages.
- **Token Expiry and Refresh:** Handling expired tokens for better security.
- **Role-based Access Control:** Granting permissions based on user roles.
- **Secure Storage:** Storing tokens securely to prevent XSS attacks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `npm start`.
4. Register a new account and explore authentication features.
